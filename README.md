This was created to help book writers like myself track the stats of our characters.
Currently only one character is supported (may stay that way so feel free to edit).
I'm new to coding and currently just finished chapter 9 of the python crash course book when this idea came to me and I did it with the help of chatgpt.
Chat didn't really give much useful code so I had to figure it out and I'm proud to say it only took two days :)

Anyways before using you should edit the attributes of your character, ie, changing the name, initial stats at level 1, exp needed to level up and so on.
Enjoy!
Oh and I also have no idea how to use github so send me a message if anything.
