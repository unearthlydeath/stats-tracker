This was created to help book writers like myself track the stats of our characters.
Currently only one character is supported (may stay that way so feel free to edit).
I'm new to coding and currently just finished chapter 9 of the python crash course book when this idea came to me and I did it with the help of chatgpt.
Chat didn't really give much useful code so I had to figure it out and I'm proud to say it only took two days :)

How to use: 

Starting with the 'stats' code, change/include things that are missing to what you prefer, like the exp to next level or health points gained when character levels up.
Next go into the 'tracker' code. Here you can add all the mobs in your book and the exp each gives. Just copy and paste the existing code and edit.
You can also change the default stats like name, level and such under MC = Character on line 90. After all is set simply run the code and enter the details (if any).
You will also get a message that the character gained X exp. Don't worry it just loads the total amount of exp that was saved previously. This only happens if you enter 'q' without entering a monster type.
